## RageQuit VS Code Theme

I got tired of searching for a dark color theme that I liked, so I "RageQuit" and made this one.

It's based loosely on [Monokai Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode), as installed free from the VS Code Marketplace.

I focused mainly on C/C++ syntax highlighting, making the code more readable with a very dark background, slightly muted foreground colors, and less color variation overall. I did open some Python, Lua, JavaScript, and other files, and they seemed reasonably highlighted as well.
